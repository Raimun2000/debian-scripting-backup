# debian-scripting-backup
Backup scripting between two servers using SSH to connect, RSYNC to backup and EXIM4 to sending alerts and logs.

Hi, this is my first contribution on Github.

I will publicate my functionally code of the basic backup tools for use between two servers. (I will do that as soon as posible).

Thanks for your patient!
